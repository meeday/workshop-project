# Learning Management System (LMS)
Welcome to our Learning Management System (LMS) project! Our ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive Learning Management Service that connects learners to a wide array of learning resources across different topics. This service will facilitate access to educational materials, connect learners with tutors, and allow educators to create diverse content types such as long video courses, short video snippets, reading materials, and more.

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a scalable and feature-rich Learning Management Service. We envision a system that empowers learners, tutors, and educators alike by providing a platform for learning and teaching in a variety of formats and topics.

## Final Goals

   - **Learning Resource Access:** Learners can easily access a broad spectrum of learning resources, from comprehensive courses to short video snippets and reading materials.

   - **Learner-Tutor Connectivity:** Connect learners with experienced tutors for guidance, assistance, and mentorship.

   - **Diverse Content Creation:** Educators can create and publish different types of content, tailored to the needs of the learners, including long video courses, short video snippets, reading materials, interactive quizzes, and more.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Our MVP version is a stepping stone towards achieving the final goals. The MVP focuses on creating a simple web application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that serves as a glossary of topics covered in class. This glossary will contain notes, code snippets, and links to useful resources for each topic.

### MVP Features
   - **Glossary Creation:** Functionality to create and manage glossary items, including detailed notes, associated code snippets, and links to resources.

   - **Topic Sections:** Glossary items will be organised into topic sections for easy navigation and categorisation.

   - **Enrollment and Viewing:** Users can enroll in topics and view glossary items within those topics.

**Technologies Used for MVP**
   - **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the web application.
   - **CSS:** Stylesheets for layout and presentation of the web application.
   - **JavaScript:** Programming language for implementing interactivity and logic.

### Installation and Setup (MVP)
To set up the MVP locally, follow these steps:

   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

   - Open the project directory and navigate to the index.html file.

   - Open index.html using a web browser to view the LMS MVP.

### Future Iterations
  - Account Creation
  - User Authentication
  - Browse available topics and enroll in the ones you're interested in.
  - Explore the glossary items, read the notes, and review the provided code examples.

In future iterations, we plan to expand the MVP into a full-fledged Learning Management Service by incorporating the final goals described earlier.
